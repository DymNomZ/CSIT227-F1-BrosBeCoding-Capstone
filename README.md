Simple 2D Game made with friends just for fun and learning purposes.

# 🍀 Map Editor Info 📝:
❗**Instructions:**

Set an index for each tile. The default is 0. Leaving the index as is will render it void.<br>
Use different indexes for each tile. Having the same index for each tile will cause conflicts. Only the first tile with the same index will be read.<br>
For now, you are responsible for keeping track of the latest index. I will add a feature to automatically increment in the future.<br>

🕹**Controls:**

Left-click = place/remove tile | Click a tile to select/deselect it, deselecting will replace your cursor with a void tile, allowing you to remove tiles.<br>
Right-click = drag grid<br>
Middle-click = toggle paint mode< hotkeybr>
Mouse-wheel = zoom<br>
